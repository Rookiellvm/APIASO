# Othread Obfuscator

APIASO is an LLVM-based obfuscation tool that perfectly implements API call obfuscation for C/C++ code under Windows platform with x86 architecture.

## 0x01 Principle

we propose an API call obfuscation method with address space obscurity. For the API address space, the internal functions of the API are encrypted and moved to the user code space for execution, blocking the connection between the API and its own address space, making it impossible for an analyst to use the API address space to perform anti-obfuscation. We develop an archetypical compiler-level API call obfuscation system to automate the obfuscation of input source code into an obfuscated file. The experimental results show that our approach can thwart existing API deobfuscation techniques and show strong resistance in the face of various open-source dynamic analysis platforms. Compared with other obfuscation techniques, our scheme performs better in obfuscating the API address space.

## 0x02 How to use

1. Compile the source code and ".\source\*.cpp" into LLVM intermedia representation
2. Utilize llvm-link to merge all intermedia representation files into one
3. Input the file generated by step2, ".\obfuscator\APIASO.exe" will output obfuscated intermedia representation
4. Link the file output by step3 to generate an executable file

Usage: `API.exe xxx.bc xxx-obf.bc`
